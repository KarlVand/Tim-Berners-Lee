### remake the page as you see it.

# Karl Vandooren - Swartz 9

## Project

We've received an image of a page, which contains an article about ***Tim Berners-Lee***, the *father* of the *World Wide Web*. Our task is to replicate the design of the page, as close as possible, using only **html** and **css**. This project pulls together the knowledge we acquiered ( or tried ) during our 2 first weeks at BeCode.

## Skills

- Look and learn
- html structure and html5 *semantic*
- CSS styling 
- CSS positionning
- and also how to use git and github efficiently!

 ## Outcomes

 > You can be proud of yourself, you implemented your first mockup into HTML and CSS. You might think it’s a small task, but think about all you’ve learned to produce this.

To be honest, it didn't go as expected but yes, whatever is missing or misunderstood, there is already a big advancement in the knowledge and skills for a third week. It is all about seeing the glass half full instead of half empty :)
